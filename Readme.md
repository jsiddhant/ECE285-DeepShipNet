# DeepShipNet: Exploring neural network architectures for locating ships in images
This code is part of the final project of the University of California San Diego Fall Semester 2018 course *Machine Learning for Image Processing*. During the project, the team participated in the Kaggle Competition *Airbus Ship Detection*[1] using the same code.  
Read the following instructions if you would like to run the code yourself.

### Executable Files
For a quick demo, run the Jupyter Notebook `demo.ipynb`.  
For a full training on the dataset, run the Jupyter Notebook `train.ipynb`.

### Requirements
The dataset can be downloaded on the kaggle competition website[1].  
In the notebooks, the following locations are referenced.  
Adapt the code or make sure to recreate the data structure:  
csv data for labels: `/datasets/ee285f-public/airbus_ship_detection/`  
training data: `/datasets/ee285f-public/airbus_ship_detection/train_v2/`  
test data: `/datasets/ee285f-public/airbus_ship_detection/test_v2/`  

To run the notebook, you need the following packages installed:
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
